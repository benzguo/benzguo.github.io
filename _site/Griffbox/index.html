  <p>Griffbox was inspired by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_button_accordion">chromatic button accordion</a>&#39;s compact keyboard layout. The same mapping works surprisingly well on the computer keyboard, and gives the keyboardist a far greater range than standard mappings that imitate piano keyboards. A chromatic button-style mapping allows 32 contiguous notes, while a standard piano-style mapping allows only 19. Mapping computer keyboard keys to musical notes also creates a unique environment for exploring language generated melodies.</p>

<p>This was one of my first personal programming projects (early 2011), built in C++ with <a href="http://www.juce.com/about-juce">JUCE</a>. You can download the original binary <a href="">here</a>, or check out <a href="https://benzguo.github.io/bayan">bayan</a>, an open source online reincarnation.</p>

<p>I wrote a piece for Griffbox in 2012, setting text from a theme written by Gertrude Stein for her sophomore composition course at Radcliffe. &quot;In a Psychological Laboratory&quot; (December 19, 1984) is a chilling depiction of early psychophysics research, and appears to describe an early polygraph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next she finds herself with a complicated apparatus strapped across her breast to register her breathing, her finger imprisoned in a steel machine and her arm thrust immovably into a big glass tube. She is a surrounded by a group of earnest youths who carefully watch the silent record of the automatic pen on the slowly revolving drum.</p>

<p>Strange fancies begin to crowd upon her, she feels that the silent pen is writing on and on forever. Her record is there she cannot escape it and the group about her begin to assume the shape of mocking fiends gloating over her imprisoned misery. Suddenly she starts, they have suddenly loosened a metronome directly behind her, to observe the effect, so now the morning&#39;s work is over.</p>
