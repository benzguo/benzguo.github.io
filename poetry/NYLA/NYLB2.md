### introduction
```
your  rustling reflects       the forest your flashlight 
flickers        on the river you look       up at the moon 
and you are       thirsty every night        you sleep for 
3 hours           and look for 23       years for the outside 
beyond inside       because no more sleep              is 
no more and no less        than what you think     you 
remember now    
```
