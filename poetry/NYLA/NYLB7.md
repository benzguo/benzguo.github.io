### Phaeton
```
he takes off his brass helmet and switches guitars
this is a new song he says 
helios the sun is too loud can you turn that down

his face is the cold cathode inside your flatbed scanner
and his eyes are two reflections in

the window of a moving train detaches images 
from the speeding landscape like leaves that

brushed from the red and white internal image of
a checkered vinyl tablecloth behind a neon sign

he sings 
you are the reflections that detach me 
you are the image floating in air 

i am the modern media landscape and this 
is the great survey of space

wait for me because you know it takes time
for first impressions to etch themselves into metal
or the brain

```
