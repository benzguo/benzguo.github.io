### reflection 1
```
and reflected from above the lake there is a river 
inside an ocean of feathers and wax 

where silence laps the shores of cold and white 
racing through sound in  silent   spiraling 
      reverberations
      
and brush strokes dance and decay
on the film of a brilliant night
       footage measured in miles of mirror 
a river an ocean 
        a protean juice box

outside beyond inside {

the crescent moon 
dreams of arcane accounting systems
 mahogany covered in formless forms 
covered in a luminous coating of coalescing riders 
 and a white fern waiting in a gym locker
bleached with the spiritual exhaustion of 
       five unfilled prescriptions unlost 
               across six unfolded dreams        }

```
