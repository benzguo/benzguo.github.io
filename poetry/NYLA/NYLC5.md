>The first sensation of identity felt after death resembles that which is felt during life on awakening in the morning, when still confused with the visions of the night, the mind, wavering between the past and the future, endeavors to recover itself, and at the same time to retain the vanishing dreams, the pictures and events of which are still passing before it.
>—Camille Flammarion, Lumen (1872)
