### october 3
```
remember       once you escaped       time without leaving 
that singular moment    when you both escaped          together 
by the lake     but now you always escape    further and further apart 
when you took       a picture but you        lost the film so you took 
a picture of the picture and     gave her           the original 
and you thought you both     thought            it was funny then 
but now you know          it isn't funny at all
```
