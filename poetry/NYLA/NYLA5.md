```
plasma reacts with aluminum shards and components 
of the atmosphere
the reaction also liberates hydrogen gas which 
churns the mixture
and improves the interaction between 
the plasma and the air

eyes:
rinse immediately with water 
remove headgear 
then flush eyes with water for at least 20 minutes

swallowed:
rapidly rinse mouth 
then immediately drink a glassful of milk or water
do not induce vomiting

skin:
thick blood slowly wells from 
the heaving wounded mass and 
floods the cavernous interior sensory organs with 
a white substance that sparks as it crystallizes next to 
the brain/heart and/or cinema palace

it took four days for the ultrabithorax to die
