### remind me
```
remember acting dead 
at 12 years old 
hit by enemy plasma bolt
hotter than seven sputtering suns 

your blinking chariot is still glorious 
in the most somnolent shades of chrome
still as a flagpole ringed with 
seven fluttering shadows in the eternal dusk

     remember this network sprouted 
     and not only connected spaces 
     but also transformed time

somewhere a towering abacus clicks quietly 
alone beneath the dim light of a crescent moon
counting the logic of the luminous
and the lovely uncanniness 
of being duplicated
     
inside a pressurized lunar data center 
black servers blink frantically 
barely illuminating the last breath 
of an astronaut

```
