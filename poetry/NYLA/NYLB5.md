### remind me
```
remember acting dead 
at 12 years old 
hit by enemy plasma bolt
hotter than seven sputtering suns 

your blinking chariot is still glorious 
still as a flagpole ringed with 
seven fluttering shadows in the long dusk

     remember this network sprouted 
     and not only connected spaces 
     but also transformed time

somewhere a towering abacus clicks quietly 
alone beneath the dim light of a crescent moon
ah the lovely uncanniness of being duplicated
     
inside a pressurized lunar data center 
black servers blink frantically 
barely illuminating the last breath 
of an astronaut

```
