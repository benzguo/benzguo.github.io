### october 2
```
remember     your prescriptions           remember 
how you       folded               them into roses and 
sent them       down the river     with transfer of interest 
agreements and the     moon outside         your 44th floor 
window but    you're still thinking about how      you tried 
the 53 candles     that arrived in the mail     last night and 
you still can't remember

```
