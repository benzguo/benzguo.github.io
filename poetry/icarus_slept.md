### icarus slept

```
{ memories flash like custom rims 
softer than water after splashing

	{ after splashing water
	on translucent bean sprouts
	she stands and calls my name but I 
	am already } here

where forty nine simultaneous horses 
bisect connecticut in a polyester mi
dnight compiled from internet resear
ch and an out of print japanese maga
zine article

where whispering egg whites speak in stolen 
lullabies lifted from candles 
softer than lilac blossoms

where children of the internet secretly fuck the internet
faster than the american racing stripes strapped to the sunset }

	here
strap on your lobster
slowly
```
