### after Rev. Akegarasu

```
my thought is thought
it is never art
i had thought my thought is art
but now i'm aware i made a terrible mistake

my experience is experience. it
is never art. i had thought
experience is 
art, but now i'm aware
i made a terrible mistake

my feelings are feelings
they are never art
i had thought my feelings
are art,
but now i'm aware
i made a terrible mistake

my deeds are deeds,
they are never art.
i had thought that my deeds are art,
but now i'm aware
i made a terrible mistake

but then
what is art?

yes, it is true, that through
thought, experience, feeling, and deed
i manifest art,
but i also manifest art
when i break out
of all of these.

i am not such a limited art,
conceptualized art,
as to exist apart from others!
i alone
am the most noble:
i embrace the cosmos.

what an indescribable, subtle
existence this is!â€“i cannot in
speaking or writing
put down what this is!

i always touch this indescribable art,
always follow this indescribable art.
truth is here.
