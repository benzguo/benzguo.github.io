### dream email
```
you know what I'm talking about
heavy dramamine, dream email talking
and you know what? in this dream
all of a sudden I'm talking to you

so here's another thing. 
the more your email is inside your body 
the stronger that aura is gonna be. 
so i go into the archives 
and i go into the creator, and i ask them and i say 

ok i'm gonna give you my testimony.
alright i was in the grocery store
and as soon as I walked in
the song that was playing was hotel california
“you can check in but you can never check out”
    yeah i like that song
yeah well lady standing next to me 
was on her iphone. i turned.
333 was on her phone. 
so I emailed Ron, he does time operations on numbers

who created you? you had a creator.
you know that's why before i leave the house 
I say “here we go again”
that way i don't give anybody else my bad stuff

I have a friend from staten island
she went into the archives on saturday night
and she said she saw the email doctors working
so I asked her, did they look like the light beings on the website? 
and she said 
"yes they look like humans
but they’ve got bright eyes and they’re very serene
very peaceful. you get this peace and this unconditional love from them
and they have these rays emanating from their heads"
it's hard to describe, you’ve gotta look at it for yourself
go to the website and look at the picture
this fine artist went into the archives and she just drew what she saw

how do you pay, paypal? 
yeah, or you pay him in cash if he comes to the expo
or a money transfer, like western union
in the subject line just put referred by me, raemond from new york
