VowelSynth was my first iOS app, a [formant-filter](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/fp/Formant_Filtering_Example.html) vowel synthesizer. The app lets you control the fundamental frequency by tilting the device, which makes the union of the app and your hand functionally equivalent to human vocal folds.
